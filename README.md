Simple Mini Shell, C

# LISH (LIttle SHell)
LISH is a simple Linux-based shell I built for educational purposes.
It is not meant to be fully functional or production-ready, but rather
to demonstrate the basic input -> parse -> execute cycle found in real
shells such as bash, tcsh, or zsh.

# FEATURES
LISH can run a wide range of everyday terminal commands, including
ls, pwd, mkdir, cd, rmdir, cp, mv, rm, cat, man, clear, ps, grep,
echo, whoami, wc, sort, and exit.

You can also:

    - Create files with touch
    - Open and edit files with vi
    - Save, compile and run code
    - Navigate directories and manage files
    
all from within this shell interface.

# NOTES
This project was built on a Linux machine, and may not work properly
on Windows or other environments without modification.
